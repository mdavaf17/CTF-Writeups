There is `memcmp(&favorite,myInput,14);` function that compares the first 14 bytes of memory area &favorite and memory area `myInput`.

The `favorite` data is `4d 79 7c 70 7b 80 47 52 59 5c 4c 4e 4c 59`.

Previously, there is `for loop` that adding our input with '\a', BELL character in C. So, our correct input should substract with '\a' first.

```python
encoded_hex = b'\x4d\x79\x7c\x70\x7b\x80\x47\x52\x59\x5c\x4c\x4e\x4c\x59'
decoded = bytearray()
for byte in encoded_hex:
    decoded_byte = byte - 7
    decoded.append(decoded_byte)

payload = decoded.decode('utf-8')
print(payload)

# Fruity@KRUEGER
```

Input the payload will result the flag.
