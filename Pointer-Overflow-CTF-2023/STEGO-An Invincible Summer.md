# Steganography

## An Invincible Summer
<!-- duplicate, picsel, double, bmp -->

I seem to have misplaced the flag for this challenge. I know that it's in one of these files. I just can't remember which one... And why would I have two copies of each image in different formats... I swear, I'd forget my head if I didn't have SQL constantly orbiting it.

HINT: This challenge is giving a lot of people trouble. I've double checked everything, and I can unequivocally say it's all picsel perfect.

### Solution

In the hint, there is a strange word, namely **picsel**. I tried searching on Google, **picsel steganography** and found SSuite Picsel Security Software.

Open lock.bmp as original image and decrypt the lock.png would result the flag.
