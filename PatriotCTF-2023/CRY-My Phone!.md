## My Phone!
<!--UMBRELLA CRYPTOGRAM CRYPTOGRAPH SQUIDGAME-->

Some weird triangle man stole my phone, he taunted me by sending me his location but it seems to be encrypted with some odd cipher I've never seen before, could you please help me get my phone back?

### Solution

Decode using https://www.dcode.fr/gravity-falls-bill-cipher. 

**FOURSIX.SEVENSIXEIGHT,-NINETWO.ONETWOFOUR** ==> 46.78 , -92.124

Locate the coordinate as longitude and lattitude.
